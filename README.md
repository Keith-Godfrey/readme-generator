  # Description
  This is a README file generator, that will help you create your file quickly, by taking you through a series of questions. This application will create a header in Markdown format for each question and any information that you passed along with it and copy it and create a README.md file. It will also create a table of contents that you can click on each link, it will take you to that specific category in the README file.
